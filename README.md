# Key-Sender
This is a simple and straight forward C# Console App project that sends keys (characters) to a specific process that you choose.

## Implementation
The "target" process is selected by the user by specifying the process's name. This can be easily refined by using any other property of the Process class and also by using Linq.

## Applicability
Basically, using this project you can simulate the key pressing in your app, which is the most important thing in the bots world.
